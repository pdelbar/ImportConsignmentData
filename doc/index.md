## Scope

Currently, the NxtPort platform processing of CUSCAR and CUSRES messages covers
- **import** operations
- **first submission (9)** CUSCAR with a **positive (44)** CUSRES response.

_Note_: additional cases (updates sent by agent, partial approvals by customs ...) are being developed and the API documentation will be modified to reflect this.
